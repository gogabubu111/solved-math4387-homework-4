<h1>Problem 1</h1>

Describe UN11 data in the alr4 package in your own words. You can get details using ?UN11 and googling things. Provide descriptive statistics and plots with your description.

<h1>Problem 2</h1>

Using the UN11 data set in the alr4 package:

<ol>

 <li>Fit a simple linear regression of <em>y </em>= log(fertility) on <em>x</em>=pctUrban.</li>

 <li>Provide the equation for the fitted model.</li>

 <li>Use the model fit in a. to provide an interpretation of the association between pctUrban and fertility in the context of the problem.</li>

</ol>

<h1>Problem 3</h1>

Fit the regression of <em>y </em>= log(fertility) on <em>x</em><sub>1 </sub>= log(ppgdp) and <em>x</em><sub>2 </sub>= lifeExpF.

1

<ol>

 <li>What is the equation for the fitted model?</li>

 <li>If we increase ppgdp by 25%, what is the expected decrease in fertility?</li>

 <li>Using your computation from part b (i.e., for a 25% increase in ppgdp), provide an interpretation of the association between ppgdp and fertility in the context of the problem.</li>

</ol>
